# Horse Vs. Human image classification using convolutional networks

Started with the original files from the web page of Google's [Tensor Flow online data set catalogue](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/horses_or_humans) by Laurence Moroney.

Then reconsider the mix of train and test and decided to mix all files and made an 70/15/15 split into train, validation, and test sets.


The rest of the code follows the pattern for binary classification of example of cats Vs Dogs from the book of Francois Chollet with J.J. Allaire, [Deep Learning with R](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r).
